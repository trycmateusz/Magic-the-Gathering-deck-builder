# Magic the Gathering Deck Builder - Recrutiment Task.

This project was made for a recruitment task for [Loyaltek](https://www.loyaltek.com).<br>
This was a revision of React for me, since I focused mainly on Vue and it's libraries.<br>
This task made me realize that I can work very effectively even with tight deadlines and tools I'm not 100% comfortable with.<br>
At the end I'm very happy with how the whole thing turned out, even though it's a simple application : D .<br>
